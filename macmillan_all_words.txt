it behoves someone to do something
it cannot be otherwise
it could be worse
it could not be otherwise
it depends
it doesn't make any odds
it doesn't make any odds to me
it figures
It girl
it goes to show
it is a fact that
it is all too easy for someone to do something
it is all too easy to do something
it is easy for someone to do something
it is easy to do something
it is just as well
it is no accident
it is no secret that
it is not for lack of trying
it is not for want of trying
it is not worth the candle
it is only fair
it is tempting to do something
it is tipping down
it is tipping it down
it isn't over until the fat lady sings
it looks
it makes a change
it makes me puke
it makes me want to puke
it matters
it might be wise to do something
it never hurts to do something
it never rains but it pours
it only remains for me to do something
it remains for me to do something
it remains to be seen
it remains to be seen how
it remains to be seen what
it remains to be seen whether
it seems
it serves someone right
it serves someone right for doing something
it shows
it stands to reason
it stands to reason that
it takes all sorts
it takes all sorts to make a world
it takes one to know one
it takes two to tango
it transpired
it transpired that
it was always going to be...
it will come out in the wash
it won't hurt you to do something
it would be an honour
it would be idle to do something
it would be wise to do something

it wouldn't do any harm
it wouldn't do someone any harm
it wouldn't harm someone to do something

it's a fair cop
it's a funny old game
it's a funny old world
it's a game of two halves
it's a good idea to do something
it's a good job
it's a good job that
it's a good thing that
it's a long story
it's a pity
it's a pleasure to do something
it's a pleasure to meet you
it's a small world
it's a wonder
it's a wrap
it's a... thing
it's all go
it's all Greek to me
it's all in your mind
it's all right
it's all right for some
it's all right for some people
it's all right for someone
it's all the same to someone
it's always the way
it's an ill wind
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it's as broad as it is long
it's bad enough
it's difficult enough
it's early days
it's easier said than done
it's fair to say
it's fair to say that
it's funny
it's getting to the point where...
it's getting to the stage where...
it's goodbye something and hello something
it's goodbye something and hello to something
it's goodbye something hello something
it's goodbye something hello to something
it's goodbye to something and hello something
it's goodbye to something and hello to something
it's goodbye to something hello something
it's goodbye to something hello to something
it's Greek to me
it's hard enough
it's high time that
it's human nature
it's just a thought
it's just human nature
it's just that...
it's little wonder
it's little wonder that
it's more than my job's worth
it's my pleasure
it's news to me
it's no bother
it's no skin off my nose
it's no use
it's no wonder
it's no wonder that
it's not as if...
it's not every day that
it's not funny
it's not someone's day
it's not that...it's just that
it's not the end of the world
it's nothing
it's now or never
it's OK
it's one thing to..., it's a different thing to...
it's one thing to..., it's another thing to...
it's only a matter of time
it's only a question of time
it's only human nature
it's only to be expected
it's raining cats and dogs
it's safe to say
it's small wonder
it's small wonder that
it's someone's funeral
it's someone's loss
it's the same old story
it's the story of my life
it's the thought that counts
it's to be expected
it's your choice
it's your lookout
